# Production Deployment Checklist - NeoRust SDK v0.4.4

This checklist ensures safe and successful deployment of NeoRust SDK applications to production environments.

## Pre-Deployment Phase

### 🔒 Security Review
- [ ] Run `cargo audit` - ensure 0 vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review SECURITY_AUDIT_v0.4.4.md findings

- [ ] Confirm no hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] Enable HTTPS for all RPC endpoints
- [ ] Configure firewall rules for Neo ports (10331-10334)
- [ ] Set up API key rotation schedule
- [ ] Review and apply rate limiting policies

### 🧪 Testing Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite: `cargo test --workspace`
- [ ] Execute integration tests against testnet
- [ ] Run property-based tests: `cargo test --features proptest`
- [ ] Perform load testing with expected traffic
- [ ] Verify gas estimation accuracy on mainnet
- [ ] Test transaction signing with hardware wallets
- [ ] Validate error handling and recovery paths
- [ ] Check memory usage under load

### 📊 Performance Baseline
- [ ] Run benchmarks: `cargo bench`
- [ ] Document baseline metrics:
  - [ ] Transaction throughput: _____ tx/sec
  - [ ] RPC response time: _____ ms
  - [ ] Memory usage: _____ MB
  - [ ] CPU usage: _____ %
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring alerts
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling thresholds

## Configuration Phase

### 🔧 Environment Setup
```bash
# Production environment variables
export NEO_NETWORK="mainnet"
export NEO_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://mainnet1.neo.org:443"
export NEO_WALLET_PASSWORD="<secure_password>"
export NEO_MAX_RETRIES="3"
export NEO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS="30"
export NEO_ENABLE_MONITORING="true"
export NEO_LOG_LEVEL="info"
export RUST_LOG="neo3=info"
```

### ⚙️ Production Configuration
```toml
# Cargo.toml optimizations
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3          # Maximum optimizations
lto = true            # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1     # Single codegen unit for better optimization
strip = true          # Strip symbols for smaller binary
panic = 'abort'       # Smaller binary, no unwinding
```

### 🌐 Network Configuration
- [ ] Configure connection pool size (recommended: 20-50)
- [ ] Set appropriate timeouts:
  - [ ] Connection timeout: 30s
  - [ ] Request timeout: 60s
  - [ ] Idle timeout: 300s
- [ ] Enable circuit breakers with thresholds:
  - [ ] Failure threshold: 5 failures
  - [ ] Recovery timeout: 60s
  - [ ] Success threshold: 3 successes
- [ ] Configure retry policies:
  - [ ] Max retries: 3
  - [ ] Retry delay: 1000ms with exponential backoff

### 💰 Gas Configuration
- [ ] Set gas price limits
- [ ] Configure safety margins (15-20% recommended)
- [ ] Implement gas price monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for unusual gas consumption

## Deployment Phase

### 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Create deployment tag: `git tag -a v0.4.4-prod -m "Production release"`
2. [ ] Build release binary: `cargo build --release`
3. [ ] Run final security scan on binary
4. [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
5. [ ] Perform smoke tests on staging
6. [ ] Deploy to production with blue-green strategy
7. [ ] Verify deployment with health checks

### 📝 Deployment Verification
```bash
# Health check endpoints to verify
curl https://your-api.com/health
curl https://your-api.com/ready
curl https://your-api.com/metrics
```

### 🔄 Rollback Plan
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Test rollback in staging
- [ ] Keep previous version binary available
- [ ] Maintain database migration rollback scripts
- [ ] Document rollback decision criteria

## Monitoring & Observability

### 📈 Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] **Application Metrics**
  - [ ] Request rate and latency
  - [ ] Error rate and types
  - [ ] Transaction success/failure ratio
  - [ ] Gas consumption patterns
  
- [ ] **System Metrics**
  - [ ] CPU and memory usage
  - [ ] Disk I/O and space
  - [ ] Network bandwidth
  - [ ] Connection pool utilization

- [ ] **Business Metrics**
  - [ ] Transaction volume
  - [ ] Wallet creation rate
  - [ ] Smart contract interactions
  - [ ] Token transfer volumes

### 🚨 Alert Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: high_error_rate
    condition: error_rate > 1%
    severity: critical
    
  - name: slow_response_time
    condition: p95_latency > 1000ms
    severity: warning
    
  - name: low_success_rate
    condition: success_rate < 99%
    severity: critical
    
  - name: high_gas_usage
    condition: gas_per_tx > threshold
    severity: warning
```

### 📊 Logging Configuration
```rust
// Production logging setup
tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .with_env_filter("neo3=info,warn")
    .with_target(false)
    .with_thread_ids(true)
    .with_thread_names(true)
    .json()
    .init();
